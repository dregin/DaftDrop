Daft Drop Chrome Extension
==========================
About
-----

Inspired by www.daftdrop.com

The site provides statistics for property advertisement site www.daft.ie such as:
- Original price
- Price percentage rise/drop
- Date of entry

This extension polls daftdrop.com and displays the relevent information for a 
property on the daft.ie page as the user browses the site.

Installation
------------
The extension is not yet available through chrome's extension store as it's still a work in progress.

To install it manually, do the following.

- Clone this repo to a location on your computer.
- In chrome, click tools > extensions
- Click "Load unpacked extension..."
- Browse to the location you chose when cloning the repo above and click "Ok"

The extension is now installed.

Browse to a daft.ie page and see some useful information (hit refresh if it doesn't show first time...)
e.g. http://www.daft.ie/searchsale.daft?id=687825
